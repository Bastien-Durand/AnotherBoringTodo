# Todo App

A full-stack todo application built to practice modern web development skills and prepare for junior developer roles.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Building a complete CRUD application from scratch, starting with a React frontend and progressively adding a Node.js backend with SQL database integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend (Current Phase)

- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast development build tool

### Backend (Planned)

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Express** - RESTful API framework
- **SQL Database** - Relational data storage (PostgreSQL or MySQL)

## ✨ Features

### Current

- [ ] Create new todos with title and description
- [ ] Display list of todos
- [ ] Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Update existing todos
- [ ] Delete todos

### Planned

- [ ] REST API with Express
